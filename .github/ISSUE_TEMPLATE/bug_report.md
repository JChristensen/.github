# Guidelines for submitting issues

1. Please submit issues only for problems with this library, not for issues with your code.

2. Provide a concise description of the problem, including:
   - What you are trying to do
   - What results you expect
   - What results you are actually getting

3. Include example code that demonstrates the issue. Many times I want to duplicate an issue for myself, in order to resolve it.
   - This should be at least a snippet of code, but better yet is a complete but *minimal* program (sketch) to demonstrate the issue. I am not motivated to work on an issue if I have to wade through hundreds of lines of code with many #includes for libraries that I do not have. See [sscce.org](http://www.sscce.org/) for more suggestions on narrowing down example code to focus on the issue.  

**Thank you!**
